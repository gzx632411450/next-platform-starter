# Geographic Coordinate

Geographic coordinate uses **latitude and longitude** to locate a position.
Latitude and longitude are just like x-y axes, so you can build all kinds of graphs with them, like [[Scatterplot\|Scatterplot]] and [[Density Contour Plot\|Density Contour Plot]].

- [!] In a geographic coordinate, **latitude** comes first. But it is the north-south direction. Therefore, there is a cross between lat-long and x-y coordinates. ^5kd68p

There are also some special graphs for geographic coordinate system, but with controversial performance, like

- [-] Radius Map: use a circle with a radius dependent on an additional variable to represent a dot
- [-] Push Pin Map: use a push pin icon to represent a dot

## Implementation

### ggmap

[[R Package\|Package]] `ggmap` can generate real-world maps. It is compatible with [[ggplot2\|ggplot2]], so you can easily add layers on top of the base map. Related functions:

- `get_stamenmap`: get a US map
    - can be zoomed using option `bbox`, `zoom`, and the latitude-longitude range of the area
- `get_googlemap`: get the map of the specified latitude-longitude range from Google map
- `ggmap`: render the map

### sf and tmap

## sf and tmap

[[R Package\|R Package]] `sf` is for reading shape files (`.shp`). To see the read map, use function `st_geometry()` and plot the returned object.

[[R Package\|R Package]] `tamp` is for plotting maps (generated by `sf`) together with other data. The general workflow is

1. Get the spatial data by reading the shape file using `sf`
2. Combine spatial data and other data
    - e.g. use `left_join()`
3. plot the combined data using `tmap`
