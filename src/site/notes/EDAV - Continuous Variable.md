# Continuous Variable

A **continuous variable** can in theory take any value over its range, as opposed to a **discrete variable**.

- [~] The real world is discrete: in practice data for continuous variables are generally **rounded** to some level of measurement accuracy.

## Features of Continuous Variables

- **Asymmetry**
    - the distribution may not be symmetric like [[Normal Distribution|Normal Distribution]]
    - the distribution may be skewed to the left or right
    - [@] distributions of income
- **Outliers**
    - there may be data far from the rest of the data
- **Multimodality**
    - the distribution may have more than one peak
- **Gaps**
    - There may be ranges of values within the data where no cases are recorded
- **Heaping**
    - some values may occur unexpectedly often
- **Rounding**
    - Only certain *round* values (like integers) are found
- **Errors/Impossibilities**

Different graphs emphasize different features.

## Combine Continuous Variables and Categorical Variables

When combining [[EDAV - Continuous Variable|Continuous Variable]]s and [[EDAV - Categorical Data|Categorical Variable]]s, we should consider

- mapping options:
    - Continuous: x-axis, y-axis, color (not so great), size (not so great)
    - Categorical: color, facets (rows, columns), shape (maybe)
- Add one variable at a time
- Create more graphs if suitable options run out
- Switch options to test
