## Likert Data

Likert data is a special categorical data that uses a **psychometric scale** commonly involved in questionnaires. For example

- strongly agree
- agree
- donâ€™t know
- disagree
- strongly disagree

Relative frequency stacked [[Bar Chart|Bar Chart]]s are used to present this kind of data.

Colors play an important role in presenting this kind of data: we use a neutral color to present a neutral category, and use two different sets of colors for categories on two sides.

Another type of [[Bar Chart|Bar Chart]], **diverging stacked bar chart**s, sometimes are more suitable. They align bars with the neutral category always in the center. By doing this, the inclination stands out.

Furthermore, we can separate and even remove the neutral category.
