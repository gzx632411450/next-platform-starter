# Algorithm

**Algorithm** theory is a huge area of [[Computer Science\|Computer Science]], which focus on studying algorithms' properties like complexity, efficiency (time & memory), convergence, etc. It is deeply connected with [[Mathematical Logic\|Mathematical Logic]], [[Language\|Language]], [[Data Structure\|Data Structure]], and [[Discrete Math\|Discrete Math]].

An algorithm is any **well-defined** computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**.

    - Correctness
        - An algorithm is **correct** if, for every input, it **halts** with the correct output.

> [!note]
> This note used to be an index for notes of algorithms. However, algorithms are just general **processes** of completing different tasks, for [[Linear Algebra\|Linear Algebra]], [[Optimization\|Optimization]], [[Graph Theory\|Graph Theory]], [[Database\|Database]], etc. So it's not necessary or realistic to list all the algorithms. Therefore, this note now focuses on the algorithm theory.
